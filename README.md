# gameproject
Our second school #Project.

Create a simple game, using JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
The only instruction we had was to use JS and make sure the characters could lose points and lose the game with a game over. Apart from that, we could do anything we wanted.

->Specifications:

Each character (Roger and Herman) has 3 'lives'and 30 points of energy.
They can both attack their ennemy, or push them.
Attack = -5 points of energy
push = -1 point of energy.
Possibility of recharging energy by clicking on recharge button.
=> Game Over when one of the character loses their 3 lives.
